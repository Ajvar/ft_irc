# ft_irc

ft_irc is a 42school project where we must code an irc server from scratch using C++98.
The server must implement basic irc functions such as sending private messages, channel messages and using channel and user modes.

## How to use

```make && ./ircserv <port_number> <password>```

### Disclaimer
This is a school project, do not use as a real irc server.
